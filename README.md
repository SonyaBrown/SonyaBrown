- 👋 Hi, I’m @SonyaBrown
- 👀 I’m interested in creating databases in situations where they are desperately needed to make life easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning more about making databases and ways to make them user friendly for queries and data input for users who are not computer savvy.
